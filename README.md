# CS-330 Final Project – 3D Kitchen Countertop Scene

## Project Overview

This repository contains my final milestone for **CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization** at Southern New Hampshire University. The goal of this project was to design and develop a fully realized 3D scene that demonstrates my understanding of geometric modeling, material design, texture mapping, lighting, and camera control in OpenGL. 

My final scene recreates a kitchen countertop, featuring a stone-textured surface, a realistic wooden bowl, and a wooden spoon. Each of these elements was crafted using basic 3D shapes like cubes, spheres, and cylinders, and manipulated through transformations (translation, scaling, rotation) to achieve accurate spatial composition. Materials were applied using realistic texture images, while multiple light sources enhanced the sense of depth and surface interaction.

This project serves as a showcase of my ability to plan, build, and refine a cohesive 3D environment using industry-standard techniques in computational graphics.

## 1. How Do I Approach Designing Software?

Working on this project provided me with hands-on experience in software design from a graphics perspective. I learned how to think spatially, plan object layout in 3D space, and organize visual elements in a way that makes sense both aesthetically and technically. One key design skill I developed was learning to model realistic objects from primitive shapes—constructing a spoon, for example, required combining cylinders and ellipsoids and carefully manipulating their position and scale.

The design process I followed was iterative and layered. I began by roughly placing shapes to outline the scene's layout, then incrementally refined their geometry, materials, and alignment. Texture design required experimenting with UV scaling and alignment to create natural-looking surfaces, especially on curved objects like the bowl.

In future projects, I will adopt an approach that begins simply, refines in stages, and emphasizes continuous visualization from the user's perspective. This strategy will enable me to create software that is both functional and visually appealing. Additionally, it has enhanced my ability to distinguish between form and function in software components.

## 2. How Do I Approach Developing Programs?

This project pushed me to apply structured programming and debugging practices in a visual domain. I used modular development techniques to build each object in isolation before integrating it into the whole scene. For example, I developed and tested the bowl's transformation logic and texture independently before introducing lighting effects or adding the countertop.

I also improved my use of iteration in my workflow. Every change to lighting, camera angle, object position, or material properties was followed by immediate visual testing to verify its impact. This tight feedback loop helped me fine-tune the scene and catch small alignment issues early.

My development skills evolved substantially during the milestones. I transitioned from writing one-off transformation code to building reusable transformation blocks and managing the scene hierarchy more cleanly. I also gained confidence in managing file structures, working with shaders, and applying lighting techniques that highlight object detail without overexposing or flattening the scene.

These are all development strategies I will carry into future courses and projects, especially in game development, UI prototyping, or any field that combines graphics with interactivity.

## 3. How Can Computer Science Help Me in Reaching My Goals?

This course and project helped bridge the gap between abstract computer science knowledge and real-world, visual results. Before CS-330, my work in computer science had mostly involved back-end logic, algorithms, or command-line applications. Working with OpenGL introduced me to a new way of thinking—how to turn data and math into visual output that users can understand and interact with.

Learning how computational graphics and visualizations work has opened the door to future roles in interactive software design, game development, AR/VR, and data visualization. The ability to build and manipulate 3D environments also gives me a strong foundation for future studies in advanced graphics, simulation engines, or creative technologies.

Both professionally and educationally, these skills position me to take on projects that involve real-time rendering, animation, or user-facing interfaces with spatial awareness. I now feel more confident designing intuitive, engaging, and technically sound graphical systems.
